    0 | struct Pawn
    0 |   int m_Id
    4 |   _Bool m_IsAlive
    8 |   int m_HP
      | [sizeof=12, dsize=12, align=4
      |  nvsize=12, nvalign=4]

* The digit in the first column is the offset of the member in the stuct.
* sizeof is how much the `sizeof` operator will return
* dsize is the size without the extra tail padding
* align is the alignment of the structure

### Alignment

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment

+++

+++ slide

In short - the CPU is most effective to load data at addresses that are multiple
of a 4, 8, 16, 64, etc. Therefore the compiler generates the code so that the
address of every variable is a multiple of its alignment.

+++

+++ slide

In C++11, the `alignof` operator gives the alignment of a type.

    static_assert(alignof(bool) == 1, "the alignment of bool is 1");

+++
+++ slide

* `m_IsAlive` is `bool`, size 1, alignment 1
* `m_HP` is `int` - size 4, alignment 4

The compiler must create a hole of 3 bytes in `Pawn` in order to fulfill the
alignment of `m_HP`.

+++

+++ slide

### Padding

The extra empty spaces that the compiler places inside user-defined types in
order to properly align their members.

+++

+++ slide

### Padding caveats

The padding is filled with random data. You *SHOULD* never use it.

    Pawn p1, p2;
    
    if (std::memcmp(&p1, &p2, sizeof(p1)))

This will take the 3 random bytes in `p1` and `p2` into the comparison and might
return that they are different, although all of their data members are actually
equal.

## Inheritance
+++

+++ slide

    struct Player : Pawn {
        const char* m_Name;
        int m_Score;
    };

+++

+++ slide

The alignment of pointers depends on the architecture. So the layout also
depends on the architecture.

+++

+++ slide

64-bit architecture

     0 | struct Player

The members of the derived class are laid out after the members of the base
class.

# Virtual Functions
+++

+++ slide
    struct Pawn {
        virtual ~Pawn() {} 
        virtual void NotOverridden() {}
        virtual int Move() { return 0; }
        int m_Id;
        bool m_IsAlive;
        int m_HP;
    };
+++

+++ slide
    struct Player : Pawn {
        virtual ~Player() {}
        virtual int Move() override { return 42; }
        const char* m_Name;
        int m_Score;
    };
+++

+++ slide

Virtual functions in C++ are implemented with the so called *virtual table*. The
*virtual table* is an array of pointers to methods. Whenever a virtual method is
called, the code lookups the pointer to the method in the *virtual table* and
executes it.

+++

+++ slide

    Pawn* p = new Player;

    p->Move();
    // actually it is:
    (p->*(p->vtable[index_for_Move]))();

+++

+++ slide

    Vtable for Pawn
    Pawn::vtable for Pawn: 6u entries
    0     (int (*)(...))0
    8     (int (*)(...))(& typeinfo for Pawn)
    16    (int (*)(...))Pawn::~Pawn
    24    (int (*)(...))Pawn::~Pawn
    32    (int (*)(...))Pawn::NotOverridden
    40    (int (*)(...))Pawn::Move

+++

    Player::vtable for Player: 6u entries
    0     (int (*)(...))0
    8     (int (*)(...))(& typeinfo for Player)
    16    (int (*)(...))Player::~Player
    24    (int (*)(...))Player::~Player

`clang++`'s `-fdump-vtable-laouts` did not output anything.

The virtual tables are dumped with:

    g++ -fdump-class-hierarchy -std=c++11 -c vlayout.cc

### Multiple-inheritance

    class FlyingPawn : public Pawn, public Flying
    {
        int m_FlyingPawnMember;
    };
+++
+++ slide

The same as single inheritance, all the base classes are at the beginning of the
object in the order their are inherited.

+++
+++ slide

Given:

    class Flying {
        public:
            int altitude;
    };

+++
+++ slide
#### Pointer assignment


    FlyingPawn fp;
    Flying* f = &fp;
    cout << f->altitude << std::endl;
    // compiler generates cout << reinterpret_cast_cast<int*>(f) << endl;

What is requried from `Flying* f = &fp;` in order for the code to work?

+++
+++ slide

    FlyingPawn fp;
    Flying* f = &fp;
    // compiler generates f = &fp + offset_of_Flying_in_FlyingPawn

The offset is known at compile time, so there is no significant runtime penalty.

+++
+++ slide

    Flying* f = new FlyingPawn;
    delete f;

+++
+++ slide

Undefined behaviour. Best case - warning for deleting an object with virtual
method and without virtual destructor.

+++
+++ slide
### Virtual inheritance

The idea is simple - instead of having the base class at a fixed at compile
time offset, use a runtime offset.

Runtime offset - actually a pointer to the base class. 

+++
+++ slide

    struct Player : virtual Pawn {
        const char* m_Name;
        int m_Score;
    };

+++
+++ slide

The compiler generates a pointer to `Pawn` at the beginning of `Player` and
places the actual `Pawn` instance somewhere in `Player`. 

*Somewhere* is at the end for most implementations.

+++
+++ slide
### Multiple-inheritance with virtual functions

The object gets multiple virtual tables, one for each base class with virtual
functions. Each virtual table has the same indices as the virtual table of the
corresponding base class.

+++

## Setting of the vtable pointer

**Pseudo-C++ class for virtual tables**

    class VTable;
+++
+++ slide
    
    struct Pawn {
        Pawn(int health)
            : _vtbl(VTable_Pawn) // added by the compiler
            , m_Health(healt)
        {}
        virtual ~Pawn()
            : _vtbl(VTable_Pawn) // added by the compiler
        {}
        VTable* _vtbl;
        int m_Health;
    };

+++
+++ slide
    struct Player : Pawn {
        Player(int health, int score)
            : Pawn(health)
            , _vtbl(VTable_Player)
            , m_Score(score)
        {}
        virtual ~Player()
            : _vtbl(VTable_Pawn) // added by the compiler
        {
            this->~Pawn(); // added by the compiler
        }
        VTable* _vtbl;
        int m_Score;
    };
